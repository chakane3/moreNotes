#1 Requirements/Clarifications
    - Users can send/receive messages to other Users
    - A user can add another user to their contacts

#2 Data used
    - 1M DAU's
    - 20 messages a day (500KB) = 10MB
    1M * 10MB = 10000000MB = 10000GB = 10TB daily

    - This sytem needs to be highly available with low latency because messages are supposedly instant

#3 endpoints

    - send message
    - receive message
    - add contact
    - group message
    - user
