# Primitive Types
In this context its pretty important to know these things:
<ul>
    <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
    <li>How to use masks and create them in a machine independent way</li>
    <li>Signedness/Shifting</li>
    <li>Keep aware that commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations in parallel and reorder operations</li>
</ul>
