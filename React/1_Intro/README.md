# Intorduction
Declarative vs Imperative programming<br>
Declarative asks what should be done<br>
Imperative (vanilla JS) asks how should it be done

ReactDOM.render(html, source)<br>

npm install -g create-react-app -> Installs packages for our react app<br>
npx create-react-app projectName -> installs packages for React to function.<br>
Remember that everything we will write to render our application will be in JS. React mixes html and javascript to create applications. Therefore we wont really need to create and dig inside an index.html file.
