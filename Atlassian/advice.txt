How Do You Think Through Problems
    1. Understand the problem fully
    2. Find a solution that works
    3. Find a more efficient solution
    4. Write Code
    5. Test Code
    




















Programming Problem Patterns

Sliding Window
    Here the problem input is a linear data structure (linked list, array, string)
    The output is typically the longest/shortest substring/array or a single value

    The problems we may come across with the sliding window pattern are:

Two Pointer/ Iterators
    This is a pattern where 2 pointers iterate throught a data structure until one or both of the pointers 
    hit a certain condition. Its useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list 
    (i.e when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements).

    Ways to identify if we need the 2 pointer technique is if we have a sorted list and need to 
    find a set of eleemnts that satisify a condition.
